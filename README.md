# Home Advantage in Women’s Doubles Badminton  
Analysis of BWF World Tour (2018–2021)

This project investigates whether a home-country advantage exists in professional women’s doubles badminton. Using match data from the BWF World Tour (2018–2021), the analysis evaluates win rates, point differentials, and tournament-level performance for home vs. away teams.

## 📊 Key Measures

The analysis computes:

### 1. **Home vs. Away Win Rates**
- Identifies whether each team is competing in its home country.
- Calculates win rate:

### 2. **Point Differential**
Difference between points scored and points conceded:

### 3. **Tournament-Level Performance**
Compares results across:
- World Tour Finals  
- Super 1000  
- Super 750  
- Super 500  
- Super 300  
- Super 100  

### 4. **Statistical Tests**
- **Chi-square test** for independence of home/away and win/loss  
- **Welch’s t-test** comparing point differentials
